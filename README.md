# raycast1
First attempt at a Wolfenstein 3d style raycast engine

Requires SDL2, at least ver 2.0.10

I tried to add some neat features beyond just the basics.

This is almost completely in one spaghetti file and needs a lot of work, but it was fun and educational.
Feel free to review any of it and take whatever helps you. If you acknowledge me in some form of credits, I'd appreciate it. If not, I won't hire a lawyer.
